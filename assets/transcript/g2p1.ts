Let's start with the first one. Is the index efficient, a worldwide tour with stochastic dominance? 

Your results indicate that in certain markets, specific industries of indices have outperformed your overall market index. Should student investors who use index funds be concerned about this, and would they be better off choosing specific sectors or some indices instead of the whole market?

`  

export const partii =`
It's a very interesting paper which you found out, and, it has multiple layers there. 

So the first one is when you say outperform. So the question is:`

export const subtitle1 = `
What do we mean by outperformance?

` 

export const partiii = `Depending on what are your goals, you can look at different criteria of how to measure performance. It can be total return. It can be risk adjusted return or Sharpe ratio. It can be value at risk, which would be, the losses in details, which happens rarely.  

It also depends on your investment horizon. So do you want to, like, invest in a portfolio which delivers you higher performance whatever way you measure it within a year or within thirty years? And this will be very, very different portfolios that you construct.`

The Research

`

export const partiv = `So in this particular data, what we are looking at, we look at a different way to assess, let's say, quality of the portfolio, and this is stochastic dominance. 

So what this tool does, it looks not on one particular measure, like, mid return, variance, or, like, sharpe ratio. It actually looks more parametrically of the whole distribution of the returns, well collected from the past data, let's say, for one year of data. And then you think about comparing distributions over the returns and you pick up the best possible distribution. Just to give you an example, you can think about the simplest way over the first order's past and dominance. 

You think of the distribution. Yeah. So that's, different possibilities for the returns, and then you shift it all to the right. So this distribution will be actually much better than the previous one because it has the same risk profile in whatever way you measure risk, but it gives you high returns. So this, we would call first order stochastic dominance.`

[Insert graph: each steps]
`
export const partv = `
While second order stochastic dominance, the one which we use in this paper, so it's slightly more complex. So what it gives you, it kind of looks at integrated CDFs [(Cumulative distribution function)], but in a kind of in simple terms, it basically looks at the losses for a given threshold, but relative expected losses for each threshold. Then we compare two sets of distributions, and if in one distribution, the expected losses are always smaller than another one, so it's a better distribution. The interesting thing is that and why we use the second order stock as a dominance concept, is that it links directly to the utility. 

If you have, investors with increasing account capability functions so, again, in simple words, these investors who, like more than less yeah. We all like higher income than less income. And, also, the kind of utility of extra additional unit of income kind of decreases. Yeah. So that's why it's a concave function. 

So and then for these investors, if you have a distribution of returns, which is which dominates stochastic in other distribution, it was it will be preferable for all investors with this increasing productivity function. And this is a very powerful idea because it doesn't, it doesn't matter what exactly the risk aversion of an investor is. As long as, investor prefer more money than less and kind of the utility can deteriorate with your wealth, so the extra utility. 

So then you will be almost preferring, the dominating distribution. And then my question is that if you can construct a distribution which dominates, like, the underlying distribution, so then this would be kind of the preferred way for all risk averse investors. Yeah?  

So and then, obviously, this is very important for collective investment verticals such as, mutual funds or pension funds because they represent, like, utilities of many different people with many different types of risk aversion. Yeah? 

Some are more risk averse, others are less risk averse. But as long as everybody's somehow risk averse, if you can construct distribution which stochastically dominates the baseline, it is a better distribution for everybody, and everybody should go to this one. Yeah. So that makes sense. Good.`

Efficiency

`

export const partvi =`So now so if you start from these premises, now we make one step forward is, the efficiency. Efficiency from the stochastic dominance portfolio. What does it mean? So I think you have several assets, and you can start a portfolio out of these assets. Question. 

Is it possible to construct a different portfolio from exactly the same assets such that we create this kind of better, like, dominant distribution. Yeah? So if it's not possible, so it means that your original objective is efficient. And it doesn't mean that it will be preferred by everybody, but it means that there does not exist another one which will be preferred by everybody.`
export const capsule3 =`[Insert capsule on Capital Allocation Line]`

export const partvii = `
So that's the kind of the idea which we start looking at. We'll say, okay. Fine. The lots of index funds you said and many of them that track, market indices across the world. 

The question is, are these indices efficient from this stochastic dominance point of view? Can you do better, kind of improve your general expenditure, deviating from these indices? So, basically, what we found is that it is very difficult to do in The United States because, obviously, The US market is from the most developed, the most efficient, and the year we looked at S&P 100 index. So there, basically, what we try to do, we tried to look at the interest constituents and recombine them in a different way to create a distribution which is better, which dominates the original one. So the kind of findings are that it's very difficult to do with The US. 

So the market is very efficient. And from this stochastic point of view, from this criteria, it is very difficult to beat the in the market index. However, if you go to European markets or go further to emerging markets, then things are getting much more complicated because markets are less efficient. And there, you will be able to construct portfolios using the, indices of individual industries, which would dominate, the market so the index the overall market index. Yeah? 

But, again, the caveat here is it is not invested in single industries. Because if you invest in single industries, you are exposed to higher idiosyncratic risks of the industry. We're still diversifying. We're still diversifying across different industries, but you do this, with the different weighting schemes as you would do in the index.  

So that out of all countries which we looked at, the most difficult to address country was Japan. So basically, the method which we found out to kind of predict better strategies, tells you that, okay, in The US, there is no way to get the better strategy to stick with the index. 

In Europe, in other emerging markets, there are ways you can also predict where you should invest. Using our approach, you do it for Japan, and it doesn't work, like, at all. So in The US, it improves a little bit, but it's not really significant. While in Japan, you are actually doing worse. Yeah? And so because the market is very different. And so because the market is very different, and we couldn't find it or kind of announce the widest. So the one reason was that we had this tsunami event in our sample, and then we predict what is, you will do really well. And then because of the tsunami, it's completely disaster, and you'll, like, you lose a really lot of investment in this industry, But kind of still even if you exclude this event, it still does perform like this. It's a very, very different country from everything else.` 

export const partviii = `
Perfect. Well, that does give us insight about, how the macroeconomic environment will will affect, the results. So, like, how did you isolate those [variables].`

export const partix = `
So if you can't sometimes you can't really isolate it. And then another thing is really just the thing globally. 

We have kind of global portfolios, that things which theoretically should work and do work in some countries, maybe it work in other countries. So that's another bit.`

Perfect, thatâ€™s great!`;
